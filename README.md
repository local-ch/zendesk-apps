Local.ch Zendesk-Apps
==================

These are apps we develop for the new Zendesk.
You probably can use those with only small adaptions.

To install an app into zendesk

 - git clone the repository
 - go into one of the apps
 - zip it with `zip -r my.zip .`
 - upload into new Zendesk: settings->apps->create
 - go to "browse" and activate it
